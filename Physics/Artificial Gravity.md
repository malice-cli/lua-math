```lua

  -- Apply gravity to the object
  local gravity = 20
  obj.Velocity = obj.Velocity + Vector3.new(0, -gravity, 0) * deltaTime
  
  -- Calculate the object's new position based on its velocity

      -- Check if the distance between the objects is less than the minimum
      local dist = (newPos - otherObj.Position).magnitude
      if dist < minDist then
        -- Move the object back along its velocity vector to the point of collision
        newPos = newPos - obj.Velocity.unit * (dist - minDist)
        
        -- Calculate the direction and magnitude of the force applied by the collision
        local collisionForce = obj.Velocity.unit * (dist - minDist)
        collisionForce = collisionForce * (1 - minDist / dist)
        
        -- Apply the collision force to the object's velocity
        obj.Velocity = obj.Velocity + collisionForce

  -- Update the object's position
  obj.Position = newPos
end
```
This function applies gravity to the object, calculates its new position based on its velocity, and checks for collisions with other objects in the `objects` list. If a collision is detected, the function moves the object back along its velocity vector to the point of collision and applies a force to its velocity based on the collision. This allows the object to bounce off other objects in a realistic way.

Again, this is just an example and there are many other factors that can be included in a physics simulation. The details of the simulation will depend on the specific requirements of your game or project.
